# Subscription Service Agreement

Effective Date: 16th November, 2024

This Subscription Service Agreement (the “Agreement”) is entered into by and between Parsonos Corporation (“Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) and the individual or entity subscribing to our services (“Subscriber,” “you,” or “your”). By creating an account, subscribing to our services, or otherwise using the services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree, you must not use the services.

# 1. **Definitions**

- **“Services”** means the subscription-based Palaba service (AI Audio Cutter) provided by Parsonos Corporation.
- **“Subscription Term”** means the period during which you have access to the Services under this Agreement.
- **“User Data”** means all text documents, audio files, or other materials submitted by you for use with the Services.

# 2. **Subscription Plans and Fees**

## 2.1 Subscription Plans.
Company offers a subscription-based service with a monthly fee (the “Flat Fee”) that provides you with a set number of credits (“Included Credits”) each month. The specifics of the Flat Fee, Included Credits, and overage costs are detailed in our [Price Table], which is incorporated by reference into this Agreement.

## 2.2 Billing Structure.
- Flat Fee: The Flat Fee is charged at the start of each subscription month. This payment grants you access to the Services and a predetermined number of Included Credits for that month.
- Overage Charges: If you exceed your Included Credits during a given month, additional credits (“Overage Credits”) will be charged at the end of the month at the per-credit rate specified in the [Price Table].
- No Rollover: Unused Included Credits do not roll over to subsequent months. At the start of each new subscription month, your credit balance will reset to the number of Included Credits associated with your subscription plan.

## 2.3 Exclusive Business Deals.
In addition to our standard subscription plans, Company offers customized subscription agreements for businesses (“Business Deals”). These agreements are negotiated individually and may include:

- Custom pricing structures.
- Increased or unlimited credit limits.
- Additional services, support, or features tailored to the business’s needs.

Terms for Business Deals will be outlined in a separate written agreement between Company and the business subscriber, which will supersede the standard terms in this Agreement where applicable.

## 2.4 Example.
For illustrative purposes:

- If your plan includes 300 Included Credits for $20 per month and you use 350 credits, you will incur an additional charge of $7.50 for the 50 Overage Credits (at $0.15 per credit).
- If you only use 250 credits during the month, the unused 50 credits will not roll over and will be forfeited when your credit balance resets.

## 2.5 Payment Authorization.
By subscribing to the Services, you authorize Company to charge your designated payment method for:

- The Flat Fee at the start of each month.
- Overage Charges at the end of the month if applicable.
- Any agreed-upon charges under a Business Deal, as outlined in the specific agreement.

## 2.6 Price Changes.
