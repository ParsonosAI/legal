# Data Processing Addendum (DPA)

Effective Date: November 6, 2025
Last Updated: November 6, 2025

This Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”) forms part of the Palaba Terms of Service (“Agreement”) between the user (“You”) and Parsonos Corporation (“Palaba,” “we,” “us,” “our”).
This DPA applies only to personal, non-enterprise use of the Palaba platform.
In the English-language market worldwide: For enterprise publishing, multi-seat use, or commercial audiobook production, a separate enterprise agreement is required through Rhapid Software Solutions Inc. Contact: support@rhapidsoftware.com

This DPA is governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and applicable U.S. privacy regulations such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA).
Palaba’s practices align with major international privacy frameworks, but the Service is operated and hosted exclusively in the United States and is not presently directed to residents of the European Economic Area or the United Kingdom.
In the event of conflict between this DPA and the Agreement, this DPA prevails solely with respect to the Processing of Personal Data.

## 1. Roles
- You are the Data Controller of personal data you upload.
- Palaba acts as the Data Processor in processing that data solely to provide the Service.

We do not decide the purposes of your processing. You do.

## 2. Purpose of Processing

We process User Content and personal data only to:
- Provide script-aligned audio assembly
- Maintain, secure and improve the Service
- Facilitate user access and account management

We do not:
- Train **generative** AI models on your content
- Sell or share your data
- Use your content for marketing

## 3. Categories of Data

We may process the following types of data:
- Uploaded recordings and scripts
- Account information (name, email, login details)
- Usage metrics (tool functions used, processing time, logs)
- Optional project notes/tags

**We do not request or knowingly process sensitive personal data. You agree not to upload health data, biometric identifiers, or comparable sensitive information.**

## 4. Instructions

We process data only according to your documented instructions, which include:
- Creating and managing your projects
- Generating session outputs
- Deleting content at your request

If we cannot comply with instructions, we will notify you.

## 5. Subprocessors

We may engage subprocessors to operate the Service.
Each subprocessor is bound by a written contract imposing obligations equivalent to those in this DPA, including confidentiality, security, and deletion duties.
A current list of subprocessors, their locations, and transfer safeguards is available at https://parsonos.com/legal/third-parties and updated periodically.
Alternatively, you may contact us for the current list.
We will notify users of any material subprocessor changes before they take effect.

## 6. International Transfers

All data is stored and processed in the United States. By using the Service, you understand and agree that your information will be transferred to and processed in the United States under U.S. privacy law.
If Palaba later offers services in other regions requiring specific cross-border data transfer mechanisms, we will implement the necessary safeguards (for example, the EU Standard Contractual Clauses) at that time.

## 7. Security

We maintain reasonable and appropriate technical and organizational measures, including:
- Encrypted data storage and transit
- Access controls
- Audit logs
- Vulnerability management

## 8. Data Subject Rights
Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including access, correction, deletion, or portability.
We honor such requests to the extent required by applicable law.

Contact: legal@parsonos.com 

We will respond within required legal timelines.

## 9. Data Retention & Deletion

- You may delete content at any time
- We delete associated processing data shortly after
- Anonymous usage metrics may be retained to support system reliability
- We delete personal data from active systems within 30 days after you delete it and from backups within our regular rotation (no later than 90 days). Anonymous operational metrics may be retained indefinitely but contain no identifiers.

We honor deletion requests unless retention is required by law.

## 10. Controller Assistance

We assist you in exercising available privacy rights and in understanding how your data is processed, to the extent reasonably possible given the nature of our Service.

## 11. Breach Notification

If a data breach affecting your personal data occurs, we will notify you without undue delay and consistent with applicable law.

## 12. Limitation of Use

This DPA does not apply to:
- Enterprise or publisher use
- Studio/vendor pipelines
- High-volume professional workflows
Those require a separate Enterprise DPA through Rhapid.

## 13. Term & Termination

This DPA remains in effect as long as we process your data. Upon termination of your account, data will be deleted in accordance with this DPA.

## 14. Priority

If this DPA conflicts with the ToS, this DPA controls only for privacy and data processing matters.
