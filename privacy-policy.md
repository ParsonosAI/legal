# 3. Information Collection

## Types and Methods of Data Collection

In our pursuit to continually improve your experience with our products, we collect various types of data, specifically focusing on your usage of our product. This section details the types of information we gather and the methods employed to collect them:

1. **Interaction Data**: We record interactions within our application or plugin, such as mouse clicks, which areas of the application are accessed, and the frequency of use of certain features.

2. **Feature Usage Data**: We track which buttons and features you utilize within our application, including the frequency of their usage. This helps us understand which functionalities are most valuable to our users.

3. **Metadata of User Content**: When our product interacts with your content, such as audio files, we collect metadata. This includes, but is not limited to, the sample rate of audio files and their names. Please note that we do not collect the actual samples or the content itself.

It's important to emphasize that this data collection is confined strictly to the boundaries of our application or plugin windows.
Our objective in collecting this information is to enhance our product's functionality and user experience, ensuring that our services align closely with your needs and preferences.
Our data collection practices are firmly aligned with the principle of 'legitimate interests' as defined under regional laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
This data is integral for the continuous improvement and personalization of our product, ensuring it meets your needs effectively.
Please be aware that by using our product, you are giving your consent to this Policy.
If you do not agree with our data collection and processing practices as outlined here, we regretfully must ask you to refrain from using our product, as we currently do not offer the option for user-specific data privacy configurations.
Your understanding and cooperation in this matter are greatly appreciated.

# 4. Data Privacy and Third-Party Services

In our commitment to providing a seamless user experience, we utilize third-party services like Supabase for various functionalities within our product.
While these services enhance our offerings, we understand that they may raise data privacy concerns.
This section aims to address these concerns and explain our approach to mitigate them:

1. **Selection of Third-Party Services**: We carefully choose third-party services like Supabase that adhere to stringent data privacy and protection standards. Our selection process prioritizes services that are compliant with global data protection regulations.

2. **Data Sharing and Processing**: When using services like Supabase, certain user data may be shared with or processed by these third parties. We ensure that such data sharing and processing are conducted in accordance with our data privacy principles and are limited to what is necessary for the service provision.

3. **Data Privacy Agreements**: We enter into data privacy agreements with third-party service providers to ensure that they are contractually bound to protect any data they handle and to use it solely for the intended purposes.

4. **Transparency and User Consent**: We are committed to transparency regarding the use of third-party services. Users will be informed of the specific data that is shared with or processed by these services. By using our product, users consent to this data sharing as an integral part of the service we provide.

5. **Ongoing Monitoring and Review**: Our relationship with third-party services is not static. We continuously monitor their compliance with data privacy laws and standards, and we review our partnerships to ensure ongoing alignment with our privacy commitments.

We understand the importance of protecting your data and strive to maintain the highest standards of data privacy, even when it involves external services. If you have concerns or questions about our use of third-party services like Supabase, please do not hesitate to contact us.

## 4.1 Personalization

As part of our commitment to providing a personalized and efficient experience, we collect information that you provide to us (for instance, during your access and use of our Services and Software) or allow us to collect (such as through third-party integrations).
Additionally, we accumulate or generate details about your access and usage of our Services and Software.
This includes instances when you utilize a feature of our desktop app that connects you online.

Crucially, depending on the Services and Software you engage with, this collected information may be associated with your device, browser, or Parsonos account, or it may be linked to your content metadata.
Such associations help us to enhance the Services and Software, tailoring them more effectively to your preferences and usage patterns.
These associations are an integral part of our service, allowing us to better understand and meet your needs through our Services and Software.

# 5 Information Sharing

## 5.1 Compliance with Law Enforcement
We uphold a commitment to abide by legal standards and cooperate with law enforcement when required.
If necessary, we may disclose user and application data in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law enforcement requirements.
Our priority is to ensure the safety and legality of our operations while respecting the privacy of our users.

## 5.2 Advertisement and Data Sharing Policy
Currently, we do not engage in sharing user and application data with other companies for advertising purposes.
We understand the importance of maintaining the confidentiality of your data in this context.
However, please be aware that this stance may be subject to change in future revisions of our Privacy Policy.
Any such changes will be communicated to our users in a timely and transparent manner, ensuring that you remain informed about how your data is used and shared.

# 6. Data Security

## 6.1 Secure Data Transmission
We prioritize the security of data transmitted between our users and our Services and Software.
To safeguard this data, we employ HTTPS encryption, ensuring that all data exchanges are secure and protected.
In instances where sensitive, non-anonymous user data is involved, which cannot be appropriately secured through HTTPS, we implement additional manual encryption techniques.
This approach is designed to provide an extra layer of security for sensitive information, ensuring that your data remains confidential and secure at all times.

## 6.2 Handling of Raw User Content
When it comes to the raw content you provide to our service or product, such as audio files for processing, we have a firm policy: **this data remains exclusively on your device.**
We do not upload or store your original content on our servers.
Instead, we may use a process known as 'fingerprinting' to identify patterns or issues in user interactions, like difficulties in processing certain types of audio files or data.
Importantly, these fingerprints are created in such a way that they cannot be reverse-engineered to recreate the original data.
This method allows us to enhance and troubleshoot our service effectively while ensuring the utmost respect for your data privacy and security.

# 7. User Rights and Choices

In compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we recognize and respect the various rights you have in relation to your personal data.
This section outlines these rights and the choices available to you:

1. **Right to Access**: You have the right to request access to your personal data that we hold. This allows you to receive a copy of the personal data we have about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.

2. **Right to Correction**: If the personal data we hold about you is incorrect or incomplete, you have the right to request its correction.

3. **Right to Erasure**: Also known as the 'right to be forgotten,' this enables you to request the deletion or removal of your personal data when there is no compelling reason for its continued processing.

4. **Right to Restrict Processing**: Under certain circumstances, you have the right to 'block' or suppress further use of your personal data.

5. **Right to Data Portability**: This right allows you to obtain and reuse your personal data for your own purposes across different services.

6. **Right to Object**: You have the right to object to the processing of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something about your particular situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground.

7. **Automated Decision Making and Profiling**: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.

We are committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights in a transparent and efficient manner.
If you wish to access, correct, or delete any of your non-anonymized data, or if you have any other requests or inquiries regarding your data rights, please contact us directly.

## 7.1 Limitations on Service Provision in Case of Data Processing Objection

### 7.1.1 Right to Object and Service Continuation
Under the GDPR, users have the right to object to the processing of their personal data.
We acknowledge and respect this right.
However, it's important to note that the processing of personal data is a fundamental component of our Services and Software. 
We are dedicated to minimizing the transfer of personal data and make concerted efforts to limit it wherever feasible.

### 7.1.2 Impact of Exercising the Right to Object
If you, as a user, choose to exercise your right to object to the processing of your personal data, we regret to inform you that we may no longer be able to provide our Services and Software to you.
This is due to the intrinsic role data processing plays in the functionality and delivery of our Services and Software.

### 7.1.3 Legal Compliance and User Understanding
This approach is in compliance with legal requirements, considering the nature of our Services and Software.
We aim to be transparent about this limitation and understand it may affect your decision to use our Services and Software.

# 8. International Data Transfers

Given the global nature of our user base, it's important to address the topic of international data transfers in our Privacy Policy.
While our users are located worldwide, we currently store all analytics data on a server located within the European Union (EU).
This has specific implications for data protection and privacy:

1. **EU Data Protection Standards**: By storing data in the EU, we adhere to some of the most stringent data protection regulations in the world, as governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This ensures a high level of protection for your personal data.

2. **Transfers Outside the EU**: For users outside the EU, it's important to note that your data is transferred to and processed on a server within the EU. We take all necessary steps to ensure that these transfers comply with applicable data protection laws and that your data remains secure.

3. **Commitment to Data Security**: Regardless of your location, we are committed to protecting your data with the highest standards of security and privacy. Our measures include both technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.

4. **Ongoing Monitoring and Compliance**: We continuously monitor legal developments related to data privacy and adjust our practices as needed to stay compliant with international data protection laws.

We understand the importance of protecting your data across borders and are committed to maintaining transparency and compliance with international data privacy regulations.

## 9.3 User Engagement and Compliance
