# FAQ

**Q:** Is my data used to train generative models?  
**A:** No. Your data is used only to deliver the services you request.

**Q:** Do you claim any rights to my data?  
**A:** No. You retain full ownership of all data you provide. We operate Palaba to process it and nothing more.

**Q:** How long is project data stored?  
**A:** Data is stored only as long as needed to produce project results. Once you download your results, you may delete the session and no data will remain. Because projects can span weeks, we notify you before deleting inactive project data. If you need data retained longer (e.g. for pickups), you can prevent deletion by reopening the project in the Palaba Desktop app.

# 9. Copyright Policy. 
Company respects the intellectual property rights of others and expects users of our Site to do the same.

If you believe that one of our users is, through the use of our Site, unlawfully infringing the copyright(s) in a work and wish to have the allegedly infringing material removed, you must provide the following information in the form of a written notification:

1. your physical or electronic signature;
2. identification of the copyrighted work(s) that you claim to have been infringed;
3. identification of the material on our services that you claim is infringing and that you request us to remove;

7. a statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are either the owner of the copyright that has allegedly been infringed or that you are authorized to act on behalf of the copyright owner.

Please note that, pursuant to 17 U.S.C. § 512(f), any misrepresentation of material fact (falsities) in a written notification automatically subjects the complaining party to liability for any damages, costs and attorney’s fees incurred by us in connection with the written notification and allegation of copyright infringement.

Company will review and respond to all notifications that comply with the requirements above. We reserve the right to remove or disable access to content alleged to be infringing and to terminate the accounts of repeat infringers as determined by Company in its sole discretion.

**10.2 Dispute Resolution**

(a) Governing Law. These Terms and any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to them are governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and by the Federal Arbitration Act for matters of arbitration, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

(c) Arbitration Agreement (United States only). If you reside or are established in the United States, any dispute that cannot be resolved informally shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules.

- Each party bears its own attorneys’ fees and costs, except where applicable law provides otherwise.
- Arbitration shall be conducted on an individual basis only; no class, collective, or representative actions are permitted.

(d) Opt-Out Right. You may opt out of this arbitration clause by sending written notice within 30 days of accepting these Terms to legal@parsonos.com stating that you do not agree to arbitration. If you opt out, or if arbitration is found unenforceable, you agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue shall be the state and federal courts of New Castle County, Delaware, USA.

(e) EU and Other Jurisdictions. If you are located in the European Union, EEA, United Kingdom, or another jurisdiction where mandatory consumer-protection law prohibits binding arbitration or class-action waivers, this Section 10.2 does not apply.
