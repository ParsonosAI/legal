# I. INFORMATION WE COLLECT
We collect “Non-Personal Information” and “Personal Information.” Non-Personal Information includes information that cannot be used to personally identify you, such as anonymous usage data, general demographic information we may collect, referring/exit pages and URLs, platform types, preferences you submit and preferences that are generated based on the data you submit and number of clicks. Personal Information includes your email, which you submit to us through the registration process at the Site.

## 1. Information collected via Technology
To activate the Service you do not need to submit any Personal Information other than your email address. To use the Service thereafter, you do need to submit further Personal Information, which may include: your payment and billing information. However, in an effort to improve the quality of the Service, we track information provided to us by your browser or by our software application when you view or use the Service, such as the website you came from (known as the “referring URL”), the type of browser you use, the device from which you connected to the Service, the time and date of access, and other information that does not personally identify you. We track this information using cookies, or small text files which include an anonymous unique identifier. Cookies are sent to a user’s browser from our servers and are stored on the user’s computer hard drive. Sending a cookie to a user’s browser enables us to collect Non-Personal information about that user and keep a record of the user’s preferences when utilizing our services, both on an individual and aggregate basis. For example, the Company may use cookies to collect the following information:

## 1.1 Behavioral Analytics
We use analytics tools such as PostHog to understand feature usage and improve user experience. These tools collect pseudonymized behavioral data (page visits, events, clicks, device type, and session identifiers) through cookies and similar technologies. Analytics cookies are non-essential and used only after you provide consent through our cookie banner. You may withdraw consent at any time.

The Company may use both persistent and session cookies; persistent cookies remain on your computer after you close your session and until you delete them, while session cookies expire when you close your browser.


## 2. Information you provide us by registering for an account
In addition to the information provided automatically by your browser when you visit the Site, to become a subscriber to the Service you will need to create a personal profile. You can create a profile by registering with the Service and entering your email address. By registering, you are authorizing us to collect, store and use your email address in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## 3. Age Requirement
The Site and Services are intended only for individuals 18 years of age or older. We do not knowingly collect information from anyone under 18. If you are under 18, you must not register or use the Services. If we learn that we have collected data from a minor without verified parental consent, we will delete it promptly.

For inquiries or deletion requests related to minor data, contact legal@parsonos.com.

# II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION
## Personal Information:
Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy.
In general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide technical support, and inform users about promotional offers.
We may share Personal Information with outside parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public as required or permitted by law. 

## Non-Personal Information
In general, we use Non-Personal Information to help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information and we reserve the right to use and disclose such Non-Personal Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties at our discretion.
In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

## Data Ownership and Processing Rights
You retain full ownership of all data and materials you provide (“User Data”). We obtain no ownership rights in your content.

This license automatically terminates when the data is deleted from our systems under the retention terms below.

# III. LAWFUL BASES FOR PROCESSING

We process personal data under the following legal bases:

# IV. HOW WE PROTECT INFORMATION
We implement robust security measures designed to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction.

## 1. Account Security:
Your account is protected through OAuth authentication, meaning we do not require or store passwords. Instead, you log in securely using your email or third-party services (e.g., Google, Microsoft). This method reduces the risks associated with traditional password storage.

## 2. Technological Safeguards:
We protect your information by employing state-of-the-art security measures, including:

- **Encryption:** Data is encrypted during transmission using Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology or equivalent protocols.
- **Firewalls:** Access to our servers is protected by firewalls to block unauthorized traffic.
- **Access Controls:** Access to your information is restricted to authorized personnel who require it to perform their duties.

## 3. Acknowledgment of Risk:
While we strive to safeguard your information, no security measures are entirely infallible. Unauthorized access, data breaches, or other risks may still occur. By using our Service, you acknowledge and accept these potential risks and agree to notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorized access to your account.

In the unlikely event of a personal-data breach, we will notify affected users and, where required, data-protection authorities within applicable statutory timeframes.

# V. YOUR RIGHTS REGARDING THE USE OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION

## 1. Marketing Purposes
You have the right at any time to prevent us from contacting you for marketing purposes.  When we send a promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. Please note that notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by unsubscribing, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example, periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.

## 2. Data Retention and Deletion
We retain personal data only for as long as necessary to deliver the Services, fulfill contractual or legal obligations, or enforce our rights.

2. **Inactive Projects** – Projects not accessed for 30 days may be archived or deleted after prior notice.

5. **Legal Holds** – We may retain specific records when required by law or to resolve disputes.

After deletion, we may keep anonymized, non-identifiable data to analyze service reliability and performance.

You have the right to request access to how we process your personal data, as well as receive a machine readable copy of your data. You may also request that we correct any inaccuracies in your data or delete your data entirely. To exercise these rights, please contact us at team@parsonos.com. We will respond to your request within a reasonable timeframe and provide you with the necessary information or actions if applicable by law.
